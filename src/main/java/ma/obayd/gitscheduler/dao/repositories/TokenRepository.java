     *@Transaction Scoping: The EntityManager is bound to the scope of a transaction.
     * When a transaction begins, the container automatically provides an EntityManager 
     * that is associated with the current transaction. This EntityManager is used for all 
     * database operations within that transaction.
     * 
     *@Automatic Transaction Management: The container ensures that all changes made within a 
     * transaction are committed or rolled back as needed. When a transaction commits, 
     * the container synchronizes the persistence context with the database. 
     * If the transaction rolls back, all changes made within that transaction are discarded.
     * 
     *@Lifecycle Management: The container takes care of creating and closing the EntityManager. 
     * You donâ€™t need to manually manage its lifecycle. When a transaction is completed, 
     * the container manages the cleanup of the EntityManager.
